Currently using this repo as a place to draft a FAQ to help those new to Slack and/or digital humanities join and participate in the digital humanities Slack. Click the fourth icon on the right (the one that looks like a little book) to visit this repo's wiki, where you can read or add to the FAQ. Please feel very free to add info, pages, etc. to the wiki and entire repo!
